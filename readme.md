A directory downloader for my website based on:

https://github.com/download-directory/download-directory.github.io

I cut out a lot of the stuff I didn't need, got rid of the node modules and simplified the layout.
I also made it so it stores a top-level directory in the zip file so that it works with Arduino
sketches.
